\title{Generates a contour plot}
\usage{
ds.contourPlot(x = NULL, y = NULL, type = "combine", show = "all",
  numints = 20, method = "smallCellsRule", k = 3, noise = 0.25,
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of a numerical vector.}

\item{y}{a character, the name of a numerical vector.}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of graph to display. 
If \code{type} is set to 'combine', a combined contour plot displayed and 
if \code{type} is set to 'split', each conntour is plotted separately.}

\item{show}{a character which represents where the plot should focus.
If \code{show} is set to 'all', the ranges of the variables are used as plot limits.
If \code{show} is set to 'zoomed', the plot is zoomed to the region where the actual data are.}

\item{numints}{a number of intervals for a density grid object.}

\item{method}{a character which defines which contour will be created. If \code{method}
is set to 'smallCellsRule' (default option), the contour plot of the actual variables is
created but grids with low counts are replaced with grids with zero counts. If \code{method} is
set to 'deterministic' the contour of the scaled centroids of each k nearest neighbours of the
original variables is created, where the value of \code{k} is set by the user. If the
\code{method} is set to 'probabilistic', then the contour of 'noisy' variables is generated. The
added noise follows a normal distribution with zero mean and variance equal to a percentage of
the initial variance of each input variable. This percentage is specified by the user in the
argument \code{noise}.}

\item{k}{the number of the nearest neghbours for which their centroid is calculated.
The user can choose any value for k equal to or greater than the pre-specified threshold
used as a disclosure control for this method and lower than the number of observations
minus the value of this threshold. By default the value of k is set to be equal to 3
(we suggest k to be equal to, or bigger than, 3). Note that the function fails if the user
uses the default value but the study has set a bigger threshold. The value of k is used only
if the argument \code{method} is set to 'deterministic'. Any value of k is ignored if the
argument \code{method} is set to 'probabilistic' or 'smallCellsRule'.}

\item{noise}{the percentage of the initial variance that is used as the variance of the embedded
noise if the argument \code{method} is set to 'probabilistic'. Any value of noise is ignored if
the argument \code{method} is set to 'deterministic' or 'smallCellsRule'. The user can choose
any value for noise equal to or greater than the pre-specified threshold 'nfilter.noise'.
By default the value of noise is set to be equal to 0.25.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
a contour plot
}
\description{
Generates a countour plot of the pooled data or one plot for each dataset.
}
\details{
The function first generates a density grid and uses it to plot the graph.
Cells of the grid density matrix that hold a count of less than the filter set by 
DataSHIELD (usually 5) are considered invalid and turned into 0 to avoid potential 
disclosure. A message is printed to inform the user about the number of invalid cells.
The ranges returned by each study and used in the process of getting the grid density matrix
are not the exact minumum and maximum values but rather close approximates of the real
minimum and maximum value. This was done to reduce the risk of potential disclosure.
