\alias{ds.completeCases}
\title{Identies complete cases in R objects of several Opal servers}
\usage{
ds.completeCases(x1 = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{a character denoting the name of the input object 
which can be a data.frame, matrix or vector}

\item{newobj}{a character string which provides the name for the output variable 
that is stored on the data servers.}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular Opal object(s) to use. 
If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified the default set of Opals will be used.}
}
\value{
a modified data.frame, matrix or vector from which
all rows containing at least one NA have been deleted. 
The output R object is stored in the Opal servers. 
It also returns two validity messages 
indicating the name of \code{newobj} that has been created in each data source 
and if it is valid in all servers.
}
\description{
Selects complete cases of a data.frame,
matrix or vector that contain missing values.
}
\details{
In the case of a data.frame or matrix, \code{ds.completeCases} deletes 
all rows containing one or more missing values. However \code{ds.completeCases} 
in vector only deletes the observation recorded as NA.  

Server functions called: completeCasesDS
